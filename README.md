# AIML_SoundArtsProject
SAAI Factory - Hackathon on Art and AI

WIP
====
The idea is that the videos and music are loaded to the re-direct server and that a json file is created when this is loaded, this json file contains which keywords relate to each item loaded into the server, a chatbot client and a speach recognition client then recognises the request by reading the json file and the keywords associated with each item then randomly selecting each one to be played from the cloud storage. Each video and sound has been made with different packages and instruments and methods to give various effects, the themes of these visuals are also given as a keyword method of selection, there is also a pathway into an old interactive java/javascript sound visual arts games world if you are able to run unsigned java applets and javascript.
